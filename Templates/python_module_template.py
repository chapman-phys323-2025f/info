Module Description, one line summary

(Replace this docstring with your own documentation)
The first docstring at the top of the file appears in the "Description" field
of the help command. That is, if you load a python interpreter the following
makes the docstring visible:

  $ python
  >>> import your_module
  >>> help(your_module)

Note the name "your_module" above is the filename without the .py extension.
You can check this help for any python module (sys, numpy, sympy, etc.)
to get an idea about how module documentation is usually formatted, and what
information is usually included.

This docstring should contain an overview and purpose of the code being
written below, as well as example uses (if appropriate).
"""

# Place import statements here to load code from other modules
# DO NOT IMPORT MODULES THAT YOU DO NOT NEED
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sympy as sp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numba as nb
# The above modules are commonly used for science. The "as blah"
# specification nicknames a module "blah" so you can write less
# in the rest of the module (e.g., np.array instead of numpy.array)


###
# Below is the body of the module.  Place all global constants, function
# definitions, and class definitions here.  No free-floating executable
# code should appear in a module.  Test functions should be placed in a
# separate file.
#
# All indentation should be 4 spaces!  NO TABS IN PYTHON CODE!
#
###


# When creating comments for your code, describe what you are trying to
# do at a high level. This helps guide the reader of your code to parse
# your intentions more easily. Don't describe exactly what the code does
# because that should be obvious from just reading the code.


# Put global constants at the top so they are easily found.
# Minimize the use of global constants if at all possible.
# Make global constants all capital with underscores by convention.
GLOBAL_CONSTANT_1 = 0


###
# If you are using object-oriented design, put class definitions next.
# For many scientific applications, object-oriented design may not be
# particularly advantageous, so we will not emphasize it in this course.
# For now it is safe to skip to the functions below.

    Class docstring, one line summary

    All classes should have their own documentation via docstrings.
    See the function docstring below for more detail.
    If a class does not subclass a particular other class, it should
    explicitly subclass the general class "object" as done above.
    All indentation should be 4 spaces.  NO TABS IN PYTHON CODE.
    Methods have their own docstrings (see below), so only include
    documentation about the attributes in the class docstring.

        Class constructor, one line summary

        Every class definition should have an __init__ method.
        All class methods should have their own docstrings as well.
        The first argument of every class method must be the special
        object "self", which will hold the current instance of the class.
        (This behavior is similar to 'this' in C++/Java if you are familiar.)

        The constructor initializes instance information using the arguments
        of the __init__ function. For example, class attributes may be set.

# rigid than classes to change and extend later. As such, functions
# should be your bread and butter for practical work.

def your_function(arg1, kwarg1="defaultvalue", *args, **kwargs):

    Function docstring, one line summary

    All functions should have their own documentation via docstrings.
    Function arguments are positional, unless they are provided a default
    value to become a "keyword argument".
    Here args is a list of all positional arguments beyond those listed.
    Here kwargs is a list of all keyword arguments beyond those listed.

    The function doc string should describe the name of the function,
    its return value and type (if any), and its list of arguments and
    their expected types (if any). Both positional and keyword arguments
    should be listed separately.

    For more detailed examples from Google about how to use docstrings see,

    A generator is just a function that can pause its operation to
